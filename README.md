## Data Conservancy Packaging Shared ##

The Data Conservancy develops and maintains a suite of packaging tools which produce packages that are compliant with
the following specifications:

This repository will house code and libraries shared by the package tools that we developed.

> Note: the Data Conservancy specifications are managed 
> separately, [here][spec-home].
